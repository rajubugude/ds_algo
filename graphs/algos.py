'''
Topological sorting only exists in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 
If the nodes of a graph are connected through directed edges and the graph does 
    not contain a cycle, it is called a directed acyclic graph(DAG). 

The topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph is nothing but the linear ordering
 of vertices such that if there is an edge between node u and v(u -> v), 
 node u appears before v in that ordering.
