SQL 
actual question: have two tables one is employee table and other is salary table.
emplyoee table 
    -id
    -emplyoee name

salary table
    -id
    -emplyoee id
    -amount

âœ… Common SQL Queries You Might Want:
1. Get all employees with their salaries:

SELECT e.id, e.employee_name, s.amount
FROM employee e
JOIN salary s ON e.id = s.employee_id;

2. Get the 4th highest salary (with employee details).
-- Step 1: Get the 4th highest distinct salary
SELECT e.id, e.employee_name, s.amount
FROM employee e
JOIN salary s ON e.id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.amount = (
    SELECT DISTINCT amount
    FROM salary
    ORDER BY amount DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 3
);

2. Get the 4th highest salary (with employee details) using DENSE_RANK().

SELECT e.id, e.employee_name, s.amount
FROM (
    SELECT employee_id, amount,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rnk
    FROM salary
) AS ranked_salaries
JOIN employee e ON e.id = ranked_salaries.employee_id
WHERE rnk = 4;

3. Get the highest salary per employee (if multiple entries exist):

SELECT e.id, e.employee_name, MAX(s.amount) AS highest_salary
FROM employee e
JOIN salary s ON e.id = s.employee_id
GROUP BY e.id, e.employee_name;


IF all in same table.

4th highest salary

SELECT DISTINCT amount
FROM salary
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 3;

all emplyoees with 4th highest salary.
-- Step 1: Get the 4th highest distinct salary
WITH FourthHighest AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT amount
FROM salary
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 3;
)

-- Step 2: Get all employees with that salary
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT salary FROM FourthHighest);
