🚀 Striver's A-Z DSA Sheet Solutions in Python
This repository contains my Python solutions for problems from Striver's A-Z DSA Sheet 📚. I'm solving Graphs, DP, Recursion, Trees, and more using my own approach while following the structured roadmap provided by Take U Forward.

🔗 Striver's A-Z DSA Sheet: Check it out here!

📌 Topics Covered
✔ Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths, Cycles, etc.)
✔ Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation, Optimization)
✔ Recursion & Backtracking
✔ Trees & Binary Search Trees
✔ Heap, Trie, Linked List & More!
