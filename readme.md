This repository contains my Python solutions for problems from Striver's A-Z DSA Sheet and other decent problems from leetcode 📚. I'm solving Graphs, DP, Recursion, Trees, and more using my own approach.


## 📌 Topics Covered  
✔ **Graphs** (BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths, Cycles, etc.)  
✔ **Dynamic Programming** (Memoization, Tabulation, Optimization)  
✔ **Recursion & Backtracking**  
✔ **Trees & Binary Search Trees**  
✔ **Heap, Trie, Linked List & More!**
